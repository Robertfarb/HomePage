	<p class="bioParagraph">My name is Robert Farb. I am an aspiring graphic designer
		and web designer who attended to The Buckley High School in Sherman Oaks, California.
		 This is one of my first websites, and some of my works are attatched at the top.
		 I played tennis and hockey in highschool, and love playing sports. When I first
		 enrolled at the University of Michigan, I was a student in the School of Art and Design.
		 After one year I transferred to LSA, and now have applied to the School of Information.
